  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>As a first-year student attending SJSU majoring Digital Media Art (DMA), my work over the past Fall semester spent here have been for an introductory video art course involving cultural critiques, installations, audience interactivity, and animation story-telling. I moved here to the bay area from the heart of Sacramento to study for my BFA in DMA, or for now what I think is my path as an artist. Before transitioning to the use of more digital artistic tools, my experience and skill as an artist is more involved in the traditional side of the arts, being along the lines of drawing, painting, and sculpting, rather than the use of more modern technologies like Adobe programs and digital painting software. Having grown up with an artistic background inspired by the story-telling of animators and paintings of certain digital artists of my time, I choose to explore and experiment with a variety of styles in my drawings and how variations in design can emphasize a movement or an action or convey an expression in a person, as it is to be able to tell stories with my drawings or capture a thought or feeling like a photograph.</p>
  <p>I see my artwork as a memory captured on canvas. That memory can be happy and be a reflection of what I still find beautiful in people and society, or it can be more a more negative memory that represents an awful feeling or behavior that has plagued our current culture. A lot of my work involves mainly mental health and issues as well as significant developmental moments and experiences in the transition from adolescent to adulthood. They are subjects that are what I believe are important to be talked about and that we shouldn’t ignore for our own mental and emotional well-being as well as serve to help us better understand ourselves and our needs for our growth and development as people. Through video, I explore mainly cultural issues that my generation has brought more concerns about like climate change and mental health, in addition to one’s development and growth. I prefer to rely on atmospheric sound and or music to draw in the viewer’s ears and envoke a certain feeling within them, rather than just trying to create a stunning visual alone. I try not to make the viewer tray from what meaning I’m trying to get with the work by say an oversaturated use of visual metaphors, even what I would consider my most figurative piece doesn’t stray too far with the use of visual metaphors and can be interpreted fairly straightforward. Each project is backed by aesthetic but is carried by the subject and sound direction.</p>
