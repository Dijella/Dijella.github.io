<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/377155486">Video Project #1: Cultural Critique - &quot;What a (Wonderful) World&quot;</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user104031624">Gissella Resuello</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
  <p>The purpose of this piece is expose the horrors of deforestation and wildfires and the damage it is doing to our forests and nature. While the viewer is first presented with a more lighted showcase of the more pretty side of nature in the beginning, the second half shows the viewer how nature on the other side of the world is suffering and bring destoryed. This piece was made in inspiration of the tragic news of the amazon forests wildfires earlier in the year.</p>
 <h1>Installation - "In the Moment"</h1>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/366656035">Video Project #2: Installation - &quot;In the Moment&quot;</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user104031624">Gissella Resuello</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
 <p>This piece is meant to put the viewer in a meditative trance and a state of serenity and solitude. Dark and isolated yet calming and beautiful. It is a place to contemplate as you stare up at the jellyfish, but a few things are off to make things seem off and unrealistic, as if you were dreaming.</p>
 <p>But really, this piece was created as a way for the viewer to meditate and practice mindfulness by just being in the moment and focusing on the jellyfish swimming around and your presence in the room, as this piece is meant to be experienced as an installation meant to be viewed as projected overhead onto a large circular ceiling or shallow dome in a room. The viewer would experience the installation by laying down on their backs on cushions placed on the floor of the room. The audio would be surround sound and the video would have a fisheye effect.</p>
 <h1>Critical Interactivity - "Three Arcana"</h1>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/377502992">Video Project #3: Critical Interactivity - &quot;Three Arcana&quot;</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user104031624">Gissella Resuello</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
 <p>What I wanted to explore in this project were tarot cards and their meanings and this video is meant to go along with this <a href="https://gissellaresuello.github.io/Art75-Project-3/" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">interactive website project</a></p>. While the subject is more out there compared to other projects, I wanted it to be a choose-your-own-adventure type of experience where your decisions reflect the multiple endings and messages you get after going through of loop of exploring each card's path. The video itself is supposed to cycle through references to what is considered the main meanings of the three different cards, willpower, intuition, and change.</p>
 <h1>Animatic - "Dream Jobs"</h1>
 <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/377232639" width="640" height="342" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/377232639">Video Project #4: Animatic - &quot;Dream Jobs&quot;</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user104031624">Gissella Resuello</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
 <p>With this piece I wanted to explore the fears and doubts and stresses that come with studying for a good career or job that is uncertain. I wanted to express some similar feelings I've been going through, so this animatic deals with the stress and anxiety of not knowing what career path to take, searching for that "dream job" or path, and the drowning feeling of dread when it comes to doubting yourself and what your doing.</p>
